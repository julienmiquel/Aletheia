# Theoretical Framework: Perplexity as a Measure of Text Generation Probability

## 1. Information Theoretic Definition

Perplexity (PPL) is a measurement in Information Theory used to quantify how well a probability model predicts a sample. In the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP), it measures the uncertainty of a Language Model (LM) when generating the next token in a sequence [1].

Mathematically, for a token sequence $W = (w_1, w_2, ..., w_N)$, the perplexity is defined as the exponentiated average negative log-likelihood:

$$ PPL(W) = \exp \left( -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ln P(w_i | w_1, ..., w_{i-1}) \right) $$

Where:
-   $P(w_i | w_{<i})$ is the probability assigned by the model to the $i$-th token given the preceding context.
-   Lower PPL implies the text is "less surprising" to the model.

## 2. Forensic Application

LLMs are trained to minimize this negative log-likelihood loss. Therefore, text generated by an LLM tends to minimize PPL when evaluated by a similar model.

-   **Human Text**: Humans are stochastic and creative, often choosing "surprising" words (high information content) to convey novelty.
-   **AI Text**: Tends to follow the "path of least resistance" (greedy or nucleus sampling), resulting in statistically lower PPL.

### 2.1 The "Watermark" of Optimization
The "optimization pressure" of modern LLMs leaves a statistical artifact: a smooth probability landscape. We detect this by measuring the Delta between the text's PPL and the natural entropy rate of human language (~10-12 bits per character).

## 3. Limitations

As LLMs improve (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 3), they model human distribution better ($P_{model} \to P_{human}$). This convergence, described as the **Perplexity Gap Closure**, makes raw PPL a diminishing signal for detection, necessitating higher-order metrics like Burstiness.
